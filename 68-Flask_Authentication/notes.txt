Secrets

Encryption
Password+key -> Cipher Method = Ciphertext

Hashing - no longer need encryption key
Password -> HashFunction-> Hash
Turn that password into a Hash
    makes it almost impossible to go from Hash to password
    Hash Function calculated quickly going forward, calculated LONG going backward
Ex) Login Password ->HashFunction-> Hash
    Hash is stored in Database
    User logins in again, password goes through Hashfunction
    If database finds matching Hash, user is logged in

Hacking Passwords
Once a hacker has that hashed password. It is easier to hack those with the same hashed password.
Try to make password as LONG and complex for yourself.

Salting
password + randomcharacters ->HashFunction-> Hash
resulting hash is created with the random salt(randomcharacters) as well
MD5
bcrypt
the more rounds you salt the passwords with, the harder it is to crack
Salt Rounds
    password+salt ->HashFunction-> Hash
    Hash+salt ->HashFunction-> newHash
etc.
