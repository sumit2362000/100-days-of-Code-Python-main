Flask-WTF

Easy Form Validation - Makes sure the user is entering data in the 
required format in all the required fields. e.g. checking that the 
user's email entry has a "@" and a "." at the end. All without having 
to write your own validation code.

Less Code - If you have a number of forms in your website, using 
WTForm can dramatically reduce the amount of code you have to write 
(or copy & paste).

Built in CSRF Protection - CSRF stands for Cross Site Request Forgery, 
it's an attack that can be made on website forms which forces your users 
to do unintended actions (e.g. transfer money to a stranger) or 
compromise your website's security if it's an admin.
